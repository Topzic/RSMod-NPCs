# RSmod-NPCs (Author Topzic)
Slowly creating all NPCs within RSMod as a community!

This is in early development so many NPCs may have wrongs animations, while dumping them it also did not seperate the levels as monsters.. As an example all skeletons at the moment will have same stats. Overtime this will get correct by me, and with the help of other people! If any animations are wrong, or stats are wrong please feel free to open a an issue within the Github!
